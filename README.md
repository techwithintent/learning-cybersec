# Learning Cybersecurity
Welcome! This respository documents my learning journey in cybersecurity - from foundational topics to more advanced areas like systems exploitation and defense mechanisms.
## About Me 
I'm currently building my skills in cybersec through hands-on platforms like [TryHackMe] (https://tryhackme.com) and open coursework from [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu). I'm deeply curious about system internals, Linux command-line mastery, and secure coding practices.
## Courses & Topics I'm Exploring
Tryhackme: Pre-Security Path
Tryhackme: Cybersecurity 101 *(in progress)*
MIT OCW: Computer Systems Security
Topics: Linux fundementals, Buffer Overflows, Exploit Defenses
## What's Inside
'linux-commands.md' - Common and useful Linux CLI notes
'buffer-overflow-notes.md' - My takeaways on exploit development and memory  safety
'course-progress.md' - Timeline & reflections oon what I'm learning
'mini-labs/' - Scripts, C code, or resources used in hands-on labs
## Ongoing Goals
Reinforce Linux and scripting skills
Build hands-on knowledge through labs and CTFs
Documents key takeaways for long-term retention
Stay Curious and keep breaking things (safely)
## Let's Connect
Feel free to share ideas, challenges, or suggestions. I'm always open to learning from others!
